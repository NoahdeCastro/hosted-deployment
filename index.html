                <p>Why hello there! So you made it to my webpage huh? Here's a little about me, My name is Noah deCastro. I am an aspiring developer whos dreams are to become a world changing creator.</p>

                <p>During my junior year of highschool I got my first PC, I got super into competitvie gaming. As the years went on I fell in love with working on computer. Realizing that I would rather spend my days working on the computer than any other job, my family and i decided that coding would be something I should look into for my career. Other than gaming I enjoy playing with my dog, dirt bike riding, and watching shameless. After that little get to know me, I am super excited to take this class and learn more about coding to help my future.  </p>
